# WEEK 1: Code Refractor Challenge [HTML, CSS, and Git]

## Horiseon Challenge
* In our classes' first week's challenge we prepared ourselves for our first scenario scenario we may encounter as a web developer. We were given the starter code to refractor the Horiseon page to make it more accessible.

### Challenge Goals
 * Web Accessibility: Optimize semantic HTML elements that follows a logical structure independant of styling and position with all elements with attributes organized with proper descriptions and positioning.
 * Improve code-base: Along with all the proper elements optimized and organizated, we will also be needing to ensure that the code base is improved for long-term sustainability by checking all links are functioning properly, increasing efficiency of the CSS, and including comments before each element or section of the page. 
 * Once code base is properly functioning with our improvements we will have to deploy the application to a live URL and Github URL with a repository that satisfies our repository criterias
